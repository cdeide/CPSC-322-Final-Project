# Name: Connor Deide
# Class: CPSC 322, Fall 2022
# Programming Assignment 7
# 11/28/2022
# Did not attempt the bonus
# 
# Description: This program implements several classifiers and data evaluation
#   algorithms to make predictions on unseen instances within datasets. On top
#   of the work done in PA6, this programming assignment added a new classifier,
#   a Decision Tree, along with functionalities to print out the rules that
#   define the tree
